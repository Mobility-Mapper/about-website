# Mobility Mapper

![Mobility Mapper mockup images](assets/readme-files/Am-I-Responsive.png)

Mobility Mapper is a route finder and navigation app for users of wheelchairs, mobility scooters, tricycles and other wheeled mobility devices (referred to as wheelers). 

The purpose of this website is to gain the support needed to successfully develop and launch the app. It will generate interest by informing potential users, partners, and funders about its key features, and how it solves real-world wayfinding problems for wheelers. 

In order to build a mailing list and social media following, the home page encourages visitors to subscribe to updates and follow our Facebook, Instagram and X pages. In addition, a contact form invites potential users to get in touch and provide feedback or ask questions about the app.

A page dedicated to partnerships and funding presents a business pitch, and invites those whose goals align with ours to contact us via a form or email.

### Color Scheme
![Color scheme image](assets/readme-files/palette.png)

The primary colour used on the website is burnt orange, which is the same colour used for the app logo. Orange was chosen because it is associated with energy, happiness, and vitality. Since orange lends itself well to other colours found in nature, it is complmented with a muted yellow, coffee brown, khaki green, and a light shade of yellow-brown. 

The muted yellow is used for the call-to-action buttons that sit on the cover image, to differentiate them from the cover text background. 

Coffee brown is the colour theme of the contact forms, with a submit button of the same colour, and a lighter shade for the background, which nicely complements the light shade of orange that colours the footer directly below.

The khaki green adds variety, and is used as a complementary background for text on an image on the partnerships page. It also appears in a lighter shade as a text background in two sections further down the page.

Finally, the yellow-brown provides additional variety for the background colours of a set of list items.

### Typography

The main font used on the website is Open Sans with Sans Serif as the backup in case the former is not imported successfully. Bitter is used for the headings, as suggested by Figma as a complementary pairing with Open Sans, with Serif as the backup.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to plan the design of the website for mobile, tablet and desktop screens.

## Features

### General
* Responsive design across all device sizes.
* Similar color scheme and design throughout both pages to effectively structure, categorise and present the information to the visitors.

### Navbar

The navbar contains the Mobility Mapper logo on the left, which functions as a link to the home page.

Responsive navigation links are on the right of the navbar. On tablets and desktop screens the navigation links are visible, with the current page highlighted in orange with an orange font colour:

<img src="assets/readme-files/navbar-expanded.png" height="40">

On mobile screens the navigation links can be revealed by clicking a toggle button with a hamburger icon:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| <img src="assets/readme-files/navbar.png" width="270"> | toggle button unclicked |
| <img src="assets/readme-files/navbar-active.png" width="270"> | toggle button clicked |

The navigation bar is the same on both pages. It contains links to both pages to facilitate navigation across the site. It also contains a link to the contact form on the same page, so the contact link on the home page takes you to the personal contact form at the bottom of the home page, and the contact link on the partnerships page takes you to the business contact form at the bottom of the partnerships page. 

The navigation links have a hover effect that changes their colour to orange, to provide feedback to the user for a better user experience. In addition, the current page is indicated by bold font.

### Footer

The footers contain links to the social media channels, and convenient, relevant links for easy navigation.

The home page footer contains links to the top of the page, the email subsciption modal, the home contact form, and the partnerships page.

![Home footer image](assets/readme-files/footer-home.png)

The partnerships page footer contains links to the home page, the top of the page, and the partnerships contact form.

![Partnerships footer image](assets/readme-files/footer-partnerships.png)

[Back to top ⇧](#mobility-mapper)

### Home Page

The home page consists of four sections and a subscribe modal.

#### 1. Hero cover image and text

Visitors are greeted by a light and sunny hero image, which stretches with the screen width.

On mobile screens the image is accompanied by a prominent cover title, and the cover text sits below it, followed by two call-to-action buttons and a set of social media links. These features sit ontop of the hero image on tablet and desktop screens.

- The hero image shows a happy wheelchair user using the app on her mobile phone.

- The cover text consists of a concise overview of the purpose of Mobility Mapper and how it benefits users of wheeled mobility devices. 

- The first call-to-action button invites the visitor to subscribe to email updates, and the second to learn more about how they can help fund the development of the app.

- The social media buttons take the visitor to the Mobility Mapper Facebook page, Instagram account, or X page.

#### 2. Key features section

This section describes the key features of the app. It consists of six cards, one for each feature, with an image, feature title and description.

![Home page key features section](assets/readme-files/home-key-features.png)

#### 3. Seeking partnerships section

The purpose of this section is to guide potential partners and funders to the partnerships page.

![Home page seeking partnerships](assets/readme-files/home-seeking-partnerships.png)

#### 4. Contact section

This contact form is for potential users of the app to get in touch with us, with the option to subscribe to the email updates.

The message text area has a maximum length of 750 characters. A [Javascript event listener](assets/js/contact-personal.js#L1) counts the number of characters and displays that number below the text box, providing helpful feedback to the visitor.

When the "Submit contact form" button is clicked, the inputs are validated and another [Javascript event listener](assets/js/contact-personal.js#L11) gets the form inputs and posts them to a Google Sheets spredsheet via a Google Apps script.

![Home page contact section](assets/readme-files/home-contact.png)

#### Subscribe Modal

This modal is opened when the "Subscribe to email updates" call-to-action button in the hero section is clicked, or the "subscribe" link in the footer is clicked.

A small Mobility Mapper icon on the right of the header, and a submit button of the same colour reassures the visitor that the form belongs to the Mobility Mapper website.

When the "Submit" button is clicked, the inputs are validated and a [Javascript event listener](assets/js/subscribe.js) gets the form inputs and posts them to a Google Sheets spredsheet via a Google Apps script.

![Home page susbcribe modal](assets/readme-files/modal.png)

[Back to top ⇧](#mobility-mapper)

### Partnerships Page

The partnerships consists of eight sections.

#### 1. Hero cover image and text

The hero image depicts people working together to build a puzzle. 

It behaves similarly to the home page hero image, for consistency. It stretches with the screen width, and on mobile screens it is accompanied by a prominent cover title, with the cover text sitting below it, followed by a call-to-action button. These features sit ontop of the hero image on tablet and desktop screens.

- The cover text welcomes the visitor to the page and gives an overview of the contents of the page. 

- The call-to-action button invites the visitor to contact us, and on clicking it takes them to the business contact form at the bottom of the page.

| Desktop and tablet | Mobile |
| --- | --- |
| ![Partnerships page cover image](assets/readme-files/partnerships-cover.png) | ![Partnerships page cover image](assets/readme-files/partnerships-cover-mobile.png) |


#### 2. Contents

The contents section provides both a quick, easy to read overview of the contents of page, and enables the visitor to jump to a section of interest.

On mobile screens the contents are shown in a single column, and on tablets and desktops in two columns.

![Partnerships page contents image](assets/readme-files/partnerships-contents.png)

#### 3. The Problem

This section explains the problems that wheelers encounter when they follow routes generated by existing navigation platforms. 

Six types of barriers are presented as cards with an image and card title. On mobile screens the cards are shown in a single column, on tablets in two columns, and on desktops in three columns.

To prevent the monotony of multiple contiguous, plain blocks of text, two paragraphs are presented on a large image, which stretches with the screen size. The image shows a lady in a wheelchair looking out of the window, while stuck at home, due to a lack of knowledge of accessible routes.

![Partnerships page problem image](assets/readme-files/partnerships-problem.png)

#### 4. Our Solution

The solution section is presented as bullet points, with the Mobility Mapper wheel icon as the main bullets. The width of the container is limited so that the bulk of the text remains centered and balanced on wide screens (long sentences that sit on one line cause the majority of the text to shift to the left-hand-side of the screen).

![Partnerships page solution image](assets/readme-files/partnerships-solution.png)

#### 5. Market

Both the market size and validation sections are included here, since they are relatively small. On mobile screens the validation section sits below the market size section, and they appear side-by-side on tablets upwards.

The green-filled, rounded rectagles highlight the market size statistics, making them both easy to find and visually appealing. The maket validation text is contained in a speech bubble to represent the fact that disabled people were consulted on their view of the usefulness of an accessible wayfinding app. 

![Partnerships page market image](assets/readme-files/partnerships-market.png)

#### 6. Key Differentiators

The list of key differentiators explains what makes Mobility Mapper different from existing mapping platforms.

To make the list more visually appealing, each list item is presented on one of four different background colours, with a corresponding icon to promote better understanding. 

![Partnerships page key differentiators image](assets/readme-files/partnerships-key-differentiators.png)

#### 7. Further Benefits

This section showcases who else will benefit from the app, starting with four large-scale entities, and followed by four different groups of people using wheeled devices.

Both sets are displayed in a single column on mobile screens. The first set expands to two columns on desktops. The second set expands to two columns on tablets, and four on desktops.

The large-scale entities are presented with large, complementary icons, and for variety, the user groups as cards with an image and title.

![Partnerships page key differentiators image](assets/readme-files/partnerships-further-benefits.png)

#### 8. Business contact section

Similar to the contact section home page in location and style, the form sits above the footer. 

The introductory text makes it clear that this form is for potential partners and funders (as opposed to potential users of the app) to get in touch to initiate a discussion about partnerships or funding. 

The message text area has a maximum length of 750 characters. A [Javascript event listener](assets/js/contact-business.js#L1) counts the number of characters and displays that number below the text box, providing helpful feedback.

When the "Submit contact form" button is clicked, the inputs are validated and another [Javascript event listener](assets/js/contact-business.js#L11) gets the form inputs and posts them to a Google Sheets spredsheet via a Google Apps script.
