# Mobility Mapper

![Mobility Mapper mockup images](assets/readme-files/mockup.png)

Mobility Mapper is a route finder and navigation app for users of wheelchairs, mobility scooters, tricycles and other wheeled mobility devices (referred to as wheelers). 

The purpose of this website is to gain the support needed to successfully develop and launch the app. It will generate interest by informing potential users, partners, and funders about its key features, and how it solves real-world wayfinding problems for wheelers. 

In order to build a mailing list and social media following, the home page encourages visitors to subscribe to updates and follow our Facebook, Instagram and X pages. In addition, a contact form invites potential users to get in touch and provide feedback or ask questions about the app.

A page dedicated to partnerships and funding presents a business pitch, and invites those whose goals align with ours to contact us via a form or email.

### Color Scheme
![Color scheme image](assets/readme-files/palette.png)

The primary colour used on the website is burnt orange, which is the same colour used for the app logo. Orange was chosen because it is associated with energy, happiness, and vitality. Since orange lends itself well to other colours found in nature, it is complmented with a muted yellow, coffee brown, khaki green, and a light shade of yellow-brown. 

The muted yellow is used for the call-to-action buttons that sit on the cover image, to differentiate them from the cover text background. 

Coffee brown is the colour theme of the contact forms, with a submit button of the same colour, and a lighter shade for the background, which nicely complements the light shade of orange that colours the footer directly below.

The khaki green adds variety, and is used as a complementary background for text on an image on the partnerships page. It also appears in a lighter shade as a text background in two sections further down the page.

Finally, the yellow-brown provides additional variety for the background colours of a set of list items.

### Typography

The main font used on the website is Open Sans with Sans Serif as the backup in case the former is not imported successfully. Bitter is used for the headings, as suggested by Figma as a complementary pairing with Open Sans, with Serif as the backup.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to plan the design of the website for mobile, tablet and desktop screens.

## Features

**General**
* Responsive design across all device sizes.
* Similar color scheme and design throughout both pages to effectively structure, categorise and present the information to the visitors.

**Navbar**

The navbar contains the Mobility Mapper logo on the left, which functions as a link to the home page.

Responsive navigation links are on the right of the navbar. On tablets and desktop screens the navigation links are visible:

<img src="assets/readme-files/navbar-expanded.png" height="40">

On mobile screens the navigation links can be revealed by clicking a toggle button with a hamburger icon:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| <img src="assets/readme-files/navbar.png" width="270"> | toggle button unclicked |
| <img src="assets/readme-files/navbar-active.png" width="270"> | toggle button clicked |

The navigation bar is the same on both pages. It contains links to both pages to facilitate navigation across the site. It also contains a link to the contact form on the same page, so the contact link on the home page takes you to the personal contact form at the bottom of the home page, and the contact link on the partnerships page takes you to the business contact form at the bottom of the partnerships page. 

The navigation links have a hover effect that changes their color to orange, to provide feedback to the user for a better user experience. In addition, the current page is indicated by bold font.


* **Footer**

    was ok up to 380 - added media quire for < 380 to reposition image slightly and make text smaller

### Content

- All content was written by the developer.

### Media

### Code

The introduction text is positioned below the hero image on small screens, and moves up onto it for medium screens and above.

The subscribe form posts the name and email to a Google spreadsheet. This is done by the subscribe.js script.

To achieve the layout, we uses a combination of HTML and Bootstrap for responsiveness, along with some custom CSS for styling. The solution includes:

Flexbox for aligning the content.
Bootstrap grid for responsiveness.
Media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.
