### Code

The introduction text is positioned below the hero image on small screens, and moves up onto it for medium screens and above.

The subscribe form posts the name and email to a Google spreadsheet. This is done by the subscribe.js script.

To achieve the layout, we uses a combination of HTML and Bootstrap for responsiveness, along with some custom CSS for styling. The solution includes:

Flexbox for aligning the content.
Bootstrap grid for responsiveness.
Media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.
